# Udacity-Data-Wrangling-proj
Open street map project for the Newyouk city /Manhattan  area

ScopeÂ¶

OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world. The creation and growth of OSM have been motivated by restrictions on use or availability of map information across much of the world, and the advent of inexpensive portable satellite navigation devices.

On the specific project, I am using data from https://www.openstreetmap.org and data mungling techniques, to assess the quality of their validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity. The biggest part of the wrangling takes place programmatically using Python and then the dataset is entered into a SQLLITE database for further examination of any remaining elements that need attention. Finally, I perform some basic exploration and express some ideas for additional improvements.
